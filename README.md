# DragonBallZ

# Project Description
This a website that covers the tv show Dragon Ball Z. This is the first web development project that I have made. The technologies that I used are HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

# How It Works
I used HTML to create the layout and to add the content to my website. I also created form which takes information from the user such as their gender, age, name,etc. I then used CSS to style my project and to align the character pictures with their name/voice actors. Finally, I added JavaScript to create functions to output content onto the website. For example, If a user left an input field blank on the html form, they will get an alert telling them to fill out all fields. I used DOM methods such as document.getElementById and event listeners.
