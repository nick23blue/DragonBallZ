	    <h2>About the Show</h2>
		
	<p> Dragon Ball Z is a japanese aInime show. It follows the story of a warrior named Goku, who protects the Earth against evil. I've been a fan 
	of this show for as long as I can remember. When I watch each character train to increase their strength, it helps motivate
	me to workout. Plus, the video game series has always been one of my favorites.</p>
	
	<p> This show has always been a fan-favorite for many years. IGN has rated the show 78th out of 100 animated shows. It has 
	also ranked 50th on Wizard's Magazine's 100 greatest animated shows.
